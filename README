home brewed Scripting language named 'GOKU' !!!!
Very basic. can be used for trivial purposes like finding factorials and stuff and to display messages and to use any java static fiunction eg:- finding milliseonds since epoch you can use System:currentTimeMillis( ). . in GOKU !!!
You can use it for doing some very basic things asap !!!
Link for the same jar file containing interpreter is
https://drive.google.com/…/0BxjrnqlFzIrcZ2x1MWR1NlJUU…/view…

example usage is
use java lang .# you can use any valid java package, but only for using their static functions
def var = 0 .
print 'give a number whose square is to be found'.
get_input var.
def str='omkar'.
‪#‎def‬ ans=str+' hava' . This is a comment
def ans= var*var.
print 'answer is '+ans.

if ans ==4 then
print 'yes we are right'.
else
print 'fackar'.
stop
while ans > 0 do
print 'time in millis is'+System:currentTimeMillis( ). .# theres a jhol here while using static java functions, two '.' are needed and ( ) is needed instead of()
ans=ans-1.
print 'ans is '+ans.
stop
